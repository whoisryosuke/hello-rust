# CLI Tutorial

This is the CLI from [the tutorial inside the Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html).

## Getting Started

`cargo run --example cli-tutorial`

See `main.rs` for a code comment with how to run code exactly, there may be additional flags (to test CLI properly).
